''' HOW TO PLAY TERRITORY

The game is played on a chessboard and starts with players placing down their king and a farm, but they can't be initially placed in the center 4 squares. 
All pieces you place must be connected to your king's island (Diagonal doesn't count). If they end up isolated (via a turret firing) they are all destroyed as a state-based action.
White goes first, then Black. But black starts with an extra action point to make up for this.

On your turn you can do 1 action, which is either placing a pawn, upgrading a pawn, or firing a turret. You can also exchange 3 Action Points to get an extra action.

You can upgrade a pawn to either a Farm, a Shield, or a Turret.

Farms will give the player 1 extra action point at end of turn.
Shields, unlike other pieces, turn back into a pawn on hit. Other pieces just die.
Turrets can be fired using an Action, and can only fire diagonally. They can't hit allied pieces and can only hit pieces in their line of sight

If your king gets hit by a turret, you lose the game.

It's important to farm early game so that later on you can stack up multiple actions in one turn to make plays.
If your opponent ever places a pawn diagonal to your king, you're basically cooked, since that becomes very hard to defend.
Try to avoid situations where your pieces get destroyed via isolation, because you end up losing a lot of value from only 1 turret shot from your opponent.

Have fun :)
